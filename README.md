## ttt death panel 2

shows killer info on death with verbose (and overengineered) death messages like:\
\- You were shot in the head with a Deagle by Player (Traitor)\
\- You were shot in the crotch with a Shotgun by Player (Detective)\
\- You were blown up with an Incendiary Grenade by Player (Innocent)\
\- You were blown up with an explosive barrel by Player (Traitor)\
\- You were crushed with a microwave by Player (Innocent)\
\- You fell to your death

this is named "death panel 2" because it's inspired by an older addon called "death panel": https://web.archive.org/web/20160811170715/http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1282806

uses the Bebas Neue font: https://github.com/dharmatype/Bebas-Neue

you have to install the Bebas Neue font if you're using linux or osx because of a bug with gmod: https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/415
